## Hello there

## About
My name is Gregory Pellechi, but everyone calls me Greg. It's at this point I'm supposed to wow you with who I am. Instead let's be practical - I need a job, and you're looking for me.

Why me? Cause I'm experienced enough to know the value of teamwork and communication (I move my Jira cards and don't complain about it), I can learn anything and quickly (I did just retrain as a programmer), and my 8 years in game development mean I have experience designing for the end users. That includes others on the team, clients, customers or players.

I've lived and worked in over 10 countries, and across industries including game development, humanitarian aid and journalism. I've even run two companies. So whatever the skills you need, I've got them. And if I don't I'll get them.

Outside of programming I play rugby (though Touch Rugby these days) and otherwise focus on family.
